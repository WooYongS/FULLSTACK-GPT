For details, refer to the `LangGraph documentation <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/>`_ as well as guides for `Migrating from AgentExecutor <https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/migrate_agent/>`_ and LangGraph's `Pre-built ReAct agent <https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/create-react-agent/>`_.\n",

The backdoor manipulated sshd, the executable file used to make remote ... Now that the XZ backdoor has control over sshd, attackers can possess the encryption key used to make the SSH connections hide their malicious code in the SSH login certificate and use it as an entry point to execute various malicious actions on the compromised device - such as stealing files or installing malware (e.g., ransomware ...

      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe XZ backdoor refers to a specific vulnerability found in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils, a widely-used package in software environments. This vulnerability allows unauthorized remote SSH access by manipulating the sshd executable. Although it has serious potential implications, such as allowing attackers to steal files or install other malware, it was discovered before these versions were added to production versions of Linux. Thus, it did not affect users in a significant way. Remediation advice includes reverting to a known safe version of the software, such as 5.4.\n",

      "Final Answer: The XZ backdoor is a specific cybersecurity threat involving malicious code in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of XZ Utils that allowed unauthorized remote access by altering sshd. It was identified before widespread deployment and therefore did not notably impact users. Stakeholders are advised to use version 5.4 or other secure versions of XZ Utils.\u001b[0m\n",

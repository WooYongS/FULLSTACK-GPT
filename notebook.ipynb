For paneer, you can skip the marination step as it absorbs flavors well during cooking.\n",

      "4. **Alternative to Garam Masala**: If you don't have garam masala on hand, you can make a substitute by combining equal parts ground cumin, ground coriander, ground cardamom, and a pinch of cinnamon and cloves.\n",

      "5. **Alternative to Lemon Juice**: You can use vinegar or lime juice as a substitute for lemon juice in the marinade. The acidity will help tenderize the tofu or paneer.\n",
